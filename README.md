## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

The application is built using a **hybrid architecture** that balances rapid development with flexibility for custom features and AI integration.

### Frontend
- **React (Web)**: Provides a fast, component-driven approach to building dynamic user interfaces.  
- **React Native (Mobile App)**: Enables a native-like mobile experience with maximum code reuse from the web frontend.  
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed language that reduces runtime errors, improves maintainability, and makes the codebase scalable.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling, ensuring responsive and consistent UI across platforms.  
- **Headless UI / Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible components that give the team complete control over custom design while maintaining usability.

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase**: A modern backend-as-a-service that provides managed PostgreSQL, authentication, storage, real-time APIs, and moreâ€”removing boilerplate backend work.  
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL with **PostGIS** extension for location-based queries, enabling hyper-local job discovery.  
  - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth manages sign-up, login, and secure sessions out of the box.  
  - **Realtime:** Enables live job feeds, chat updates, and notification features.  
  - **Storage:** Secure file storage for user profile images and job-related uploads.  
- **Node.js Serverless Functions**: Handles complex, custom business logic and external API integrations in an efficient, scalable manner.

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Google Genkit with Gemini Models**: Powers the AI layer for natural language and image generation.  
  - **Job Suggestions:** Auto-generate structured job descriptions from short titles.  
  - **AI Reply Assistance:** Suggest context-aware, professional responses in chat.  
  - **Job Image Creation:** Generate unique visuals for job postings, enhancing engagement.

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub for collaboration and code management.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** TBD (GitHub Actions / Vercel / Netlify / Docker could be considered).  
- **Hosting & Deployment:** TBD, depending on cost, scalability, and team preference (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend, AWS/GCP for serverless functions).
